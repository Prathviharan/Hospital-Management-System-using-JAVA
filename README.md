<p id="description">The Project is based on Hospital Mangement System Domain .It is a web application based on java stack technologies.It is divided into three modules: Admin with log-in page, Doctor with log-in page, and User with Login page. I am attaching a demo video so you can understand my work.
                             
The functionalities of each module are:
Admin:

2.)Edit Doctor Details  
3.)Delete Doctor  
4.)View All Doctors in Hospitals with their details  
5.)View All Patients in Hospitals with their details  
6.)Add specialist doctor type  
7.) Session Logout functionality  
8.)See no of patients in the hospital  
9.)See no of doctors in the hospital  
10.)See no of appointments in the hospital and which patient has been appointed to which doctor
